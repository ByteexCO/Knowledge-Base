# (TEMPLATE) API Rate Limits

## Overview

Shopify imposes rate limits on API requests to ensure fair usage and prevent abuse. This document explains the rate limits, their implications, and strategies to handle them effectively.

## Details

- **Rate Limit Policy**: Shopify allows a certain number of requests per minute.
  - **REST API**: 40 requests per app per store per minute.
  - **GraphQL API**: A leaky bucket algorithm that permits a burst of 1000 points and refills at a rate of 50 points per second.

## Implications

Hitting the rate limit can result in delayed API responses and disrupted functionality, which can affect the user experience and application performance.

## Strategies to Handle Rate Limits

1. **Throttling Requests**: Implement logic to throttle API requests within the allowed limits.
2. **Efficient API Usage**: Optimize API calls by reducing unnecessary requests and using bulk operations where possible.
3. **Retry Logic**: Implement retry logic with exponential backoff for handling rate limit errors.

## Conclusion

Understanding and managing API rate limits is crucial for developing robust Shopify apps. By following the strategies outlined above, you can minimize disruptions and maintain a smooth user experience.



## How to deal with it

### Step 1: Identifying the Issue

- Monitored API usage to identify peak times and the frequency of rate limit errors.
- Analyzed the app's code to pinpoint areas with excessive API calls.

### Step 2: Implementing Throttling

- Added a request throttling mechanism to ensure the app stayed within the API rate limits.
- Used a queue system to manage and schedule API requests efficiently.

### Step 3: Optimizing API Usage

- Consolidated multiple API calls into single, bulk operations where possible.
- Cached frequent data to minimize redundant API requests.

### Step 4: Adding Retry Logic

- Implemented a retry mechanism with exponential backoff to handle rate limit errors gracefully.

## Results

After implementing the above steps, the app's API rate limit errors were significantly reduced, leading to successful synchronization and improved performance.

## Conclusion

Handling API rate limits effectively requires a combination of throttling, optimizing API usage, and robust error handling. By implementing these strategies, you can ensure your Shopify app operates smoothly even under high demand.
