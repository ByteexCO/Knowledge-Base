## Setting Up Your Development Environment

To get started with Shopify development, you need to set up your local development environment. Follow these steps:

### 1. Install Node.js and npm

Shopify development requires Node.js and npm (Node Package Manager). Download and install them from the [official Node.js website](https://nodejs.org/).

### 2. Install the Shopify CLI

The Shopify CLI (Command Line Interface) is a powerful tool that helps you build Shopify themes and manage your store. Install it by running:

```bash
npm install -g @shopify/cli @shopify/theme
```

### 3. Authenticate with Shopify

Once the CLI is installed, authenticate it with your Shopify account:

```bash
shopify login
```

Follow the prompts to log in to your Shopify account.

### 4. Create a Development Store

You can create a free development store for testing and development purposes. Follow the instructions on the [Shopify Partners dashboard](https://partners.shopify.com/) to create a new development store.

## Understanding Shopify

Shopify is a leading e-commerce platform that allows businesses to create and manage online stores. As a developer, you'll be working with various components and tools provided by Shopify to build and customize these stores.

### Key Components

- **Themes**: Templates that control the look and feel of a Shopify store.
- **Apps**: Extensions that add functionality to a store.
- **APIs**: Interfaces for interacting with Shopify's backend services.

## Key Concepts and Terminology

Before diving into development, familiarize yourself with these key concepts:

- **Liquid**: Shopify's templating language used to create dynamic content in themes.
- **Sections**: Modular components of a theme that can be customized through the Shopify admin.
- **Snippets**: Reusable pieces of code that can be included in templates.
- **Metafields**: Custom fields that store additional information about products, collections, etc.

## Essential Tools and Resources

Here are some tools and resources that will aid your development:

- **Shopify Dev Docs**: The official [Shopify Developer Documentation](https://shopify.dev/).
- **Shopify Polaris**: A design system and UI kit for building apps that look and feel like Shopify.
- **Liquid Documentation**: The official [Liquid documentation](https://shopify.dev/docs/themes/liquid/reference) for Shopify's templating language.

### Recommended Code Editor

We recommend using [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for your development work. It has great extensions and support for web development.

### Useful Extensions

- **Shopify Liquid Template Snippets**: A VS Code extension for Liquid snippets.
- **ESLint**: A tool for identifying and fixing problems in JavaScript code.
